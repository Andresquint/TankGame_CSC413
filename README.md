This tank game was built in IntelliJ IDEA 2018.3.4 using Java version 11. 

I was not able to get my jar working at the state my game is in right now, but the game works if you build the project in IntelliJ. Also missing from my game is split screen and minimap. Unfortunately, since I don't have a split screen, my game camera only follows one tank (tank 2). 

## Controls
Tank1:
up - up arrow key
down - down arrow key
left - left arrow key
right - right arrow key
shoot bullet - enter key

Tank2:
up - w
down - s
left - a
right - d
shoot bullet - space bar

After starting the game, press p to play. After game is over, press escape to exit.
